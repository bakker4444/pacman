### Assignment details  
The goal of this assignment/video is 1) for you to see Michael Choi's workflow and learn from how Michael builds things and 2) for you to start applying some of the algorithms you've learned to start creating simple apps.  If you're rusty on implementing the algorithms to build the necessary features, please 1) redo the algorithm app and make sure you understand all the key points in the app as well as the mandatory 13 challenges and 2) reach out to other colleagues in your group and see if they can work with you.  Don't feel bad if you don't have time to work on these assignments, but if you do have the extra time, please watch the video and work on this assignment for at least 4 hours.
